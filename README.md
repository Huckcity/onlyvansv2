# OnlyVans V2

This is the reimagined version of the classic Only Vans Android application, developed in Android Studio with Kotlin.

The app features:
1. CRUD with multiple fields and images
2. Persisted storage with Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Storage
3. Email/password or Firebase authentication options
4. Google Maps API integration for real time plotting of added vans
5. Swipe motion functions to edit/delete items
6. MVVM architecture

I personally state that I never want to work in the world of Android application development.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
